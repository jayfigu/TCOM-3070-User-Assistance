    <conbody>
        <p>A domain is the website address that customers can visit to browse and purchase from your
            store online. With Shopify you have a few options for domains depending on your
            preferences and starting point. </p>
        <p>You can have a domain through Shopify. An example of the URL for this is
            examplestore.myshopify.com.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can have a custom domain which you can either purchase a new URL or
            have one transferred to Shopify. An example of a URL for this is examplestore.com.</p>
